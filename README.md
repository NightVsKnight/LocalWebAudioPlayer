# Local Web Audio Player

Single-page MP3 folder player focused on fast local playback, rich listening history, and streamer-friendly tooling, all bundled into one `player.html`.

## Why This Exists
- YouTube/YouTube Music insert too many ads.
- VLC never quite fit the workflow.
- Automatic ‚ÄúNow playing‚Ä¶ That was‚Ä¶‚Äù voice callouts sounded fun.

## Requirements & Browser Support
- Chrome browser (not tested on any others). File System Access, Media Session, OBS export, and persistence rely on Chromium APIs.
- All data stays local: IndexedDB stores folder handles, history (latest 500 sessions), track ratings, and preferences. The optional text export writes only to the file you pick.
- Speech synthesis and AudioContext features gracefully degrade when unsupported; UI toggles reflect availability.

## Getting Started
1. Open `player.html` (`xdg-open player.html` on Linux or `open player.html` on macOS).
2. Click **Choose Folder**, grant read access, and the playlist populates instantly.
3. Use the footer **History** button to review sessions; open **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** to configure the optional OBS text export.
4. If the browser blocks direct file access, run `python3 -m http.server` and visit `http://localhost:8000/player.html`.

## Core Features
- **Persistent playback state** ‚Äì Shuffle (defaults on), loop mode, volume, last track, and announcement preference survive reloads.
- **Real-time history overlay:** Live row updates while a track plays, with per-entry delete, clear-all (with confirmation), and automatic pruning to the latest 500 sessions.
- **Percent-heard insights** ‚Äì Timers exclude paused time; badges highlight skips (<50%), completions (~100%), and rewinds (>100%).
- **Track ratings** ‚Äì Five-star ratings appear beside each track and within ‚ÄúNow Playing‚Äù, sync in both views, and persist locally.
- **Announcements & speech** ‚Äì Optional synthesized callouts with preferred-voice selection and debounced messaging.
- **Media Session integration** ‚Äì OS media keys, Bluetooth headsets, and system trays control playback and mirror metadata.
- **Spectrum analyzers** ‚Äì Neon Bars, Glow Wave, and Pulse Halo visualize 20‚ÄØHz‚Äì20‚ÄØkHz with logarithmic mapping.
- **Streamer tools:** Optional text export for OBS overlays plus Media Session integration and voice announcements.
- **YouTube-friendly metadata:** Filenames ending in `[videoId]` gain direct links back to the source.

## Playback History
- Each session records start/end timestamps, heard duration, percent played, skip detection, and rewind tagging.
- A live history row mirrors the current track; completed sessions roll into IndexedDB with automatic pruning to the newest 500 entries.
- Rows link to YouTube when filenames include `[videoId]`, offer per-entry deletion, and support bulk clear with confirmation.

## Track Ratings
- Click any of the five stars shown beside playlist rows or within the ‚ÄúNow Playing‚Äù panel to rate from one to five; clicking the active star clears the rating.
- Filled gold stars indicate the current rating; grey outlines mark unrated positions and highlight on hover.
- Ratings persist in IndexedDB, keyed by the track‚Äôs relative path, so they survive reloads and rescans of the same folder.
- Updates stay in sync between the playlist and ‚ÄúNow Playing‚Äù, and rating interactions never interrupt playback.

## Play Counts

Automatically track how many times each song has been played to identify your most-listened tracks.

### How It Works
- Each track displays a play count indicator (‚ñ∂ #) in the playlist between the rating stars and duration
- **The currently playing track shows its play count in the "Now Playing" section** between the rating stars and time display
- Play counts increment automatically when a track is played to completion (‚â•50% of duration heard)
- Tracks skipped before reaching 50% do NOT increment the counter, preventing accidental skips from inflating counts
- Play counts are stored locally in IndexedDB and persist across sessions
- Play counts are tied to the track's file path and remain even if you rescan the folder
- The count updates immediately when a track qualifies as "played"

### What Counts as a "Play"
A track is counted as played when **at least 50% of its duration is heard**. This threshold:
- Balances genuine listens vs. accidental skips
- Matches the existing skip detection threshold used in playback history
- Allows for some seeking/skipping while still counting legitimate listens
- Prevents double-counting when rewinding and replaying portions

For example:
- ‚úì Play a 3-minute track for 90+ seconds ‚Üí count increments
- ‚úì Play a 4-minute track to completion ‚Üí count increments  
- ‚úì Listen to 2 minutes of a 3-minute track, rewind, listen again ‚Üí count increments once when session ends
- ‚úó Skip after 30 seconds of a 3-minute track ‚Üí count does NOT increment
- ‚úó Quickly preview several tracks ‚Üí counts do NOT increment

### Use Cases
- Identify your most-played tracks at a glance
- See which songs you listen to repeatedly vs. skip
- Discover listening patterns over time
- Combine with ratings to distinguish "favorites I play often" from "favorites I save for special occasions"
- Use with the History overlay to see both cumulative play counts and individual listen sessions

### In the History Overlay
The History table includes a **Plays** column showing each track's current total play count. This gives context about:
- Whether this was the first time hearing a track or the 50th
- How popular a track is in your overall listening habits
- The relationship between listen duration and repeat plays

### Data Storage
- Play counts are stored in your browser's IndexedDB (separate from ratings and history)
- No external services or cloud storage involved
- Play counts remain private to your browser and device
- Clearing browser data or IndexedDB will reset all play counts

## OBS Metadata Export
- Configure once via **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** ‚Üí **Configure** to pick a text file (e.g., `now-playing.txt`). The player validates write access automatically.
- While playback is active the file contains `Title ‚Äì Artist`; it clears on pause, at the end of queues (loop off), or during folder scans.
- Reloading retains export if permission persists; Settings shows ‚ÄúActive ‚Äì filename.txt‚Äù. Unsupported browsers surface a toast explaining the limitation.
- To use in OBS Studio, add a Text source, enable ‚ÄúRead from file‚Äù, point at the export, and style as desired. Disable the feature from Settings to stop updates.

## Speech Announcements
- Toggle the `üó£ Announce` control (or press `A`) to enable spoken track transitions; the preferred voice is ‚ÄúDaniel‚Äù, with fallbacks to other English voices.
- Manual skips announce ‚ÄúSkipped ‚Ä¶‚Äù while automatic transitions announce ‚ÄúThat was ‚Ä¶‚Äù. The feature disables itself when speech synthesis is unavailable.

## Spectrum Analyzer
- Modes: **Neon Bars** (frequency bars), **Glow Wave** (oscilloscope), **Pulse Halo** (radial visualization).
- Renders 20‚ÄØHz‚Äì20‚ÄØkHz using logarithmic frequency spacing and ‚àí100‚ÄØdBFS to 0‚ÄØdBFS amplitude range. The selector hides when `AudioContext` is unavailable.
- Validation media in `testmedia/`: high-frequency tones (16‚Äì20‚ÄØkHz), white noise, and a 20‚Äì20‚ÄØ000‚ÄØHz sweep exercise each mode.

## OS Media Controls
- Media Session handlers mirror play, pause, previous, next, seek forward/backward, and seek-to actions from hardware keys and system trays.
- Metadata (title, artist, album/folder) stays synchronized with lock screens and notification centers. Unsupported browsers simply ignore the hooks.

## Manual Smoke Checks
- **Playback basics:** Load a folder, start playback, toggle shuffle/loop, adjust volume via slider and arrow keys, seek, then reload to confirm preferences persist.
- **Short track names:** Load a folder with files that have YouTube IDs (e.g., `[videoId]`), track numbers (e.g., `01 -`), underscores, or special characters.
  - Verify playlist displays clean short titles.
  - Hover over playlist items to confirm tooltips show full path.
  - Check Now Playing header and History tab also show short titles.
  - Enable announcements and confirm spoken names match displayed names.
- **History & ratings:** Watch the live history row while playing, pausing, and seeking; Skip forward a few tracks, then step backward with **Prev** until history exhausts; rate several tracks (in playlist and ‚ÄúNow Playing‚Äù), reload, and verify ratings persist without triggering playback; Delete a single history row and use **Clear**‚Äîboth should confirm before removing data.
- **Percent badges & links:** Finish a track, stop before halfway, and rewind past 100% to observe badge colors; open a history row that embeds a `[videoId]` and confirm the YouTube link resolves.
- **Streamer workflow:** Enable OBS export, verify the text file updates, pause/stop to ensure it clears, reload to confirm the export remains active, then disable and ensure updates cease.
- **Layout & accessibility:** Resize below 900‚ÄØpx to confirm the interface collapses cleanly; scroll large libraries while testing keyboard navigation; toggle announcements off/on to validate speech handling.
- **OS integration & analyzer:** Use Bluetooth or hardware media keys for transport control and check the system media overlay; exercise the spectrum modes with tones, noise, and sweeps from `testmedia/`.
- **Browser fallback:** Launch in a non-Chromium browser to confirm informative errors for folder picking or OBS export; revoke folder permission and ensure the app re-prompts gracefully.

## Manual Testing
- **Play Counts:** Load a music folder and verify each track displays a play count area (should be empty initially, showing no count).
- **Play Counts:** Play a track for less than 50% of its duration (e.g., skip after 30 seconds of a 2-minute track), skip to next track, and verify the play count does NOT increment (remains empty).
- **Play Counts:** Play a track for at least 50% of its duration (e.g., listen to 90 seconds of a 2-minute track), skip to next track, and verify the play count increments to "‚ñ∂ 1".
- **Play Counts:** Play the same track to 50%+ completion multiple times and verify the count increments each time (‚ñ∂ 2, ‚ñ∂ 3, etc.).
- **Play Counts:** Let a track play to natural completion and verify the count increments.
- **Play Counts:** Reload the page, rescan the same folder, and verify all play counts persist correctly.
- **Play Counts (Now Playing):** Start playback and verify the "Now Playing" section shows a play count between the rating stars and time (e.g., "‚ñ∂ 3" or "‚ñ∂ ‚Äî" if unplayed).
- **Play Counts (Now Playing):** Play a track to completion, let it advance to the next track, then return to the first track and verify both the playlist and "Now Playing" show the incremented count.
- **Play Counts (Now Playing):** Hover over the play count in "Now Playing" and verify a tooltip shows "Played X time(s)" or "Not played yet".
- **Play Counts (History):** Open the History overlay and verify the table includes a "Plays" column showing current play counts for each track.
- **Play Counts (History):** Play a track multiple times, open History, and verify the "Plays" column shows the cumulative count across all history entries for that track.
