# Local Web Audio Player

Very boring name for now.

I created this because:
1. YouTube/YouTubeMusic plays way too many ads
2. I did not like VLC very much
3. I wanted to add a "Now playing ... That was ... " voice

## Media
I use yt-dlp to download from YouTube playlists.

The general command is:
```
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 {URL}
```

Examples:
* My `Utho Riley` playlist: yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 PLNtyAG9UO9oeMDT193y8Zno_E8U4MMtIU
* My `White Bat Audio` playlist: yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 PLNtyAG9UO9odGA1KzBuVsern15RexNfjQ
